# Fix: Zero is feeling a little too self-important. Dividing by zero causes an
# immediate existential crisis for the CPU and violates the fundamental laws of math.
# It's the numerical equivalent of opening Pandora's Box.
# We'll use 2 instead, a much more stable and less chaotic number.
x = 10 / 2
